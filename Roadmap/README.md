### Simplified roadmap suggestion:

1. **Learn basics:**
    
    - Linux commands & basics
        
    - Networking fundamentals
        
    - HTTP and web basics
        
2. **Learn web hacking:**
    
    - Common vulnerabilities (like SQLi, XSS, CSRF, etc.)
        
    - Practice with labs and CTF challenges
        
3. **Learn network hacking:**
    
    - Packet sniffing, MITM, scanning, exploiting network services
        
4. **Learn privilege escalation:**
    
    - Windows & Linux techniques to gain higher access

### Next steps after basics:

1. **Start doing real-world practice and challenges**
    
    - Use platforms like **Hack The Box, TryHackMe, OverTheWire**, or **VulnHub**.
        
    - These have real vulnerable machines and challenges to test your skills.
        
    - It helps you apply what you learned and discover new things.
        
2. **Learn about post-exploitation**
    
    - After you get access to a system, what can you do?
        
    - Learn techniques like:
        
        - Maintaining access (backdoors)
            
        - Data exfiltration (stealing data)
            
        - Covering tracks (clearing logs)
            
        - Pivoting (moving inside the network)
            
    - This is important for advanced penetration tests.
        
3. **Study more advanced topics**
    
    - **Active Directory (AD) attacks:** Very important for real corporate networks running Windows.
        
    - **Wireless security:** Wi-Fi hacking, cracking WPA2, etc.
        
    - **Exploit development basics:** Writing or modifying exploits.
        
    - **Social engineering:** Manipulating people to get access.
        
4. **Learn scripting and automation**
    
    - Automate repetitive tasks using Python, Bash, or PowerShell.
        
    - Write your own tools or scripts to help testing.
